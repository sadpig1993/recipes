       join EXPR,LIST
               Joins the separate strings of LIST into a single string with
               fields separated by the value of EXPR, and returns that new
               string.  Example:

                   $rec = join(':', $login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);

               Beware that unlike "split", "join" doesn't take a pattern as
               its first argument.  Compare "split".
