       bless REF,CLASSNAME
       bless REF
               This function tells the thingy referenced by REF that it is now
               an object in the CLASSNAME package.  If CLASSNAME is omitted,
               the current package is used.  Because a "bless" is often the
               last thing in a constructor, it returns the reference for
               convenience.  Always use the two-argument version if a derived
               class might inherit the function doing the blessing.  See
               perltoot and perlobj for more about the blessing (and
               blessings) of objects.

               Consider always blessing objects in CLASSNAMEs that are mixed
               case.  Namespaces with all lowercase names are considered
               reserved for Perl pragmata.  Builtin types have all uppercase
               names. To prevent confusion, you may wish to avoid such package
               names as well.  Make sure that CLASSNAME is a true value.
