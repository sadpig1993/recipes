DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       "Net::FTP" is a class implementing a simple FTP client in Perl as
       described in RFC959.  It provides wrappers for a subset of the RFC959
       commands.

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.  It is a way of transferring
       files between networked machines.  The protocol defines a client (whose
       commands are provided by this module) and a server (not implemented in
       this module).  Communication is always initiated by the client, and the
       server responds with a message and a status code (and sometimes with
       data).

       The FTP protocol allows files to be sent to or fetched from the server.
       Each transfer involves a llooccaall ffiillee (on the client) and a rreemmoottee ffiillee
       (on the server).  In this module, the same file name will be used for
       both local and remote if only one is specified.  This means that
       transferring remote file "/path/to/file" will try to put that file in
       "/path/to/file" locally, unless you specify a local file name.

       The protocol also defines several standard ttrraannssllaattiioonnss which the file
       can undergo during transfer.  These are ASCII, EBCDIC, binary, and
       byte.  ASCII is the default type, and indicates that the sender of
       files will translate the ends of lines to a standard representation
       which the receiver will then translate back into their local
       representation.  EBCDIC indicates the file being transferred is in
       EBCDIC format.  Binary (also known as image) format sends the data as a
       contiguous bit stream.  Byte format transfers the data as bytes, the
       values of which remain the same regardless of differences in byte size
       between the two machines (in theory - in practice you should only use
       this if you really know what you're doing).

CCOONNSSTTRRUUCCTTOORR
       new ([ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])
           This is the constructor for a new Net::FTP object. "HOST" is the
           name of the remote host to which an FTP connection is required.

           "HOST" is optional. If "HOST" is not given then it may instead be
           passed as the "Host" option described below.

           "OPTIONS" are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value
           pairs.  Possible options are:

           HHoosstt - FTP host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as
           defined for the "PeerAddr" option in IO::Socket::INET, or a
           reference to an array with hosts to try in turn. The "host" method
           will return the value which was used to connect to the host.

           FFiirreewwaallll - The name of a machine which acts as an FTP firewall.
           This can be overridden by an environment variable "FTP_FIREWALL".
           If specified, and the given host cannot be directly connected to,
           then the connection is made to the firewall machine and the string
           @hostname is appended to the login identifier. This kind of setup
           is also referred to as an ftp proxy.

           FFiirreewwaallllTTyyppee - The type of firewall running on the machine
           indicated by FFiirreewwaallll. This can be overridden by an environment
           variable "FTP_FIREWALL_TYPE". For a list of permissible types, see
           the description of ftp_firewall_type in Net::Config.

           BBlloocckkSSiizzee - This is the block size that Net::FTP will use when
           doing transfers. (defaults to 10240)

           PPoorrtt - The port number to connect to on the remote machine for the
           FTP connection

           TTiimmeeoouutt - Set a timeout value (defaults to 120)

           DDeebbuugg - debug level (see the debug method in Net::Cmd)

           PPaassssiivvee - If set to a non-zero value then all data transfers will
           be done using passive mode. If set to zero then data transfers will
           be done using active mode.  If the machine is connected to the
           Internet directly, both passive and active mode should work equally
           well.  Behind most firewall and NAT configurations passive mode has
           a better chance of working.  However, in some rare firewall
           configurations, active mode actually works when passive mode
           doesn't.  Some really old FTP servers might not implement passive
           transfers.  If not specified, then the transfer mode is set by the
           environment variable "FTP_PASSIVE" or if that one is not set by the
           settings done by the _l_i_b_n_e_t_c_f_g utility.  If none of these apply
           then passive mode is used.

           HHaasshh - If given a reference to a file handle (e.g., "\*STDERR"),
           print hash marks (#) on that filehandle every 1024 bytes.  This
           simply invokes the "hash()" method for you, so that hash marks are
           displayed for all transfers.  You can, of course, call "hash()"
           explicitly whenever you'd like.

           LLooccaallAAddddrr - Local address to use for all socket connections, this
           argument will be passed to IO::Socket::INET

           If the constructor fails undef will be returned and an error
           message will be in $@

MMEETTHHOODDSS
       Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a _t_r_u_e or _f_a_l_s_e
       value, with _t_r_u_e meaning that the operation was a success. When a
       method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as
       _u_n_d_e_f or an empty list.

       login ([LOGIN [,PASSWORD [, ACCOUNT] ] ])
           Log into the remote FTP server with the given login information. If
           no arguments are given then the "Net::FTP" uses the "Net::Netrc"
           package to lookup the login information for the connected host.  If
           no information is found then a login of _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s is used.  If no
           password is given and the login is _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s then _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s_@ will
           be used for password.

           If the connection is via a firewall then the "authorize" method
           will be called with no arguments.

       authorize ( [AUTH [, RESP]])
           This is a protocol used by some firewall ftp proxies. It is used to
           authorise the user to send data out.  If both arguments are not
           specified then "authorize" uses "Net::Netrc" to do a lookup.

       site (ARGS)
           Send a SITE command to the remote server and wait for a response.

           Returns most significant digit of the response code.

       ascii
           Transfer file in ASCII. CRLF translation will be done if required

       binary
           Transfer file in binary mode. No transformation will be done.

           HHiinntt: If both server and client machines use the same line ending
           for text files, then it will be faster to transfer all files in
           binary mode.

       rename ( OLDNAME, NEWNAME )
           Rename a file on the remote FTP server from "OLDNAME" to "NEWNAME".
           This is done by sending the RNFR and RNTO commands.

       delete ( FILENAME )
           Send a request to the server to delete "FILENAME".

       cwd ( [ DIR ] )
           Attempt to change directory to the directory given in $dir.  If
           $dir is "..", the FTP "CDUP" command is used to attempt to move up
           one directory. If no directory is given then an attempt is made to
           change the directory to the root directory.

       cdup ()
           Change directory to the parent of the current directory.

       pwd ()
           Returns the full pathname of the current directory.

       restart ( WHERE )
           Set the byte offset at which to begin the next data transfer.
           Net::FTP simply records this value and uses it when during the next
           data transfer. For this reason this method will not return an
           error, but setting it may cause a subsequent data transfer to fail.

       rmdir ( DIR [, RECURSE ])
           Remove the directory with the name "DIR". If "RECURSE" is _t_r_u_e then
           "rmdir" will attempt to delete everything inside the directory.

       mkdir ( DIR [, RECURSE ])
           Create a new directory with the name "DIR". If "RECURSE" is _t_r_u_e
           then "mkdir" will attempt to create all the directories in the
           given path.

           Returns the full pathname to the new directory.

       alloc ( SIZE [, RECORD_SIZE] )
           The alloc command allows you to give the ftp server a hint about
           the size of the file about to be transferred using the ALLO ftp
           command. Some storage systems use this to make intelligent
           decisions about how to store the file.  The "SIZE" argument
           represents the size of the file in bytes. The "RECORD_SIZE"
           argument indicates a maximum record or page size for files sent
           with a record or page structure.

           The size of the file will be determined, and sent to the server
           automatically for normal files so that this method need only be
           called if you are transferring data from a socket, named pipe, or
           other stream not associated with a normal file.

       ls ( [ DIR ] )
           Get a directory listing of "DIR", or the current directory.

           In an array context, returns a list of lines returned from the
           server. In a scalar context, returns a reference to a list.

       dir ( [ DIR ] )
           Get a directory listing of "DIR", or the current directory in long
           format.

           In an array context, returns a list of lines returned from the
           server. In a scalar context, returns a reference to a list.

       get ( REMOTE_FILE [, LOCAL_FILE [, WHERE]] )
           Get "REMOTE_FILE" from the server and store locally. "LOCAL_FILE"
           may be a filename or a filehandle. If not specified, the file will
           be stored in the current directory with the same leafname as the
           remote file.

           If "WHERE" is given then the first "WHERE" bytes of the file will
           not be transferred, and the remaining bytes will be appended to the
           local file if it already exists.

           Returns "LOCAL_FILE", or the generated local file name if
           "LOCAL_FILE" is not given. If an error was encountered undef is
           returned.

       put ( LOCAL_FILE [, REMOTE_FILE ] )
           Put a file on the remote server. "LOCAL_FILE" may be a name or a
           filehandle.  If "LOCAL_FILE" is a filehandle then "REMOTE_FILE"
           must be specified. If "REMOTE_FILE" is not specified then the file
           will be stored in the current directory with the same leafname as
           "LOCAL_FILE".

           Returns "REMOTE_FILE", or the generated remote filename if
           "REMOTE_FILE" is not given.

           NNOOTTEE: If for some reason the transfer does not complete and an
           error is returned then the contents that had been transferred will
           not be remove automatically.

       put_unique ( LOCAL_FILE [, REMOTE_FILE ] )
           Same as put but uses the "STOU" command.

           Returns the name of the file on the server.

       append ( LOCAL_FILE [, REMOTE_FILE ] )
           Same as put but appends to the file on the remote server.

           Returns "REMOTE_FILE", or the generated remote filename if
           "REMOTE_FILE" is not given.

       unique_name ()
           Returns the name of the last file stored on the server using the
           "STOU" command.

       mdtm ( FILE )
           Returns the _m_o_d_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _t_i_m_e of the given file

       size ( FILE )
           Returns the size in bytes for the given file as stored on the
           remote server.

           NNOOTTEE: The size reported is the size of the stored file on the
           remote server.  If the file is subsequently transferred from the
           server in ASCII mode and the remote server and local machine have
           different ideas about "End Of Line" then the size of file on the
           local machine after transfer may be different.

       supported ( CMD )
           Returns TRUE if the remote server supports the given command.

       hash ( [FILEHANDLE_GLOB_REF],[ BYTES_PER_HASH_MARK] )
           Called without parameters, or with the first argument false, hash
           marks are suppressed.  If the first argument is true but not a
           reference to a file handle glob, then \*STDERR is used.  The second
           argument is the number of bytes per hash mark printed, and defaults
           to 1024.  In all cases the return value is a reference to an array
           of two:  the filehandle glob reference and the bytes per hash mark.

       feature ( NAME )
           Determine if the server supports the specified feature. The return
           value is a list of lines the server responded with to describe the
           options that it supports for the given feature. If the feature is
           unsupported then the empty list is returned.

             if ($ftp->feature( 'MDTM' )) {
               # Do something
             }

             if (grep { /\bTLS\b/ } $ftp->feature('AUTH')) {
               # Server supports TLS
             }

       The following methods can return different results depending on how
       they are called. If the user explicitly calls either of the "pasv" or
       "port" methods then these methods will return a _t_r_u_e or _f_a_l_s_e value. If
       the user does not call either of these methods then the result will be
       a reference to a "Net::FTP::dataconn" based object.

       nlst ( [ DIR ] )
           Send an "NLST" command to the server, with an optional parameter.

       list ( [ DIR ] )
           Same as "nlst" but using the "LIST" command

       retr ( FILE )
           Begin the retrieval of a file called "FILE" from the remote server.

       stor ( FILE )
           Tell the server that you wish to store a file. "FILE" is the name
           of the new file that should be created.

       stou ( FILE )
           Same as "stor" but using the "STOU" command. The name of the unique
           file which was created on the server will be available via the
           "unique_name" method after the data connection has been closed.

       appe ( FILE )
           Tell the server that we want to append some data to the end of a
           file called "FILE". If this file does not exist then create it.

       If for some reason you want to have complete control over the data
       connection, this includes generating it and calling the "response"
       method when required, then the user can use these methods to do so.

       However calling these methods only affects the use of the methods above
       that can return a data connection. They have no effect on methods
       "get", "put", "put_unique" and those that do not require data
       connections.

       port ( [ PORT ] )
           Send a "PORT" command to the server. If "PORT" is specified then it
           is sent to the server. If not, then a listen socket is created and
           the correct information sent to the server.

       pasv ()
           Tell the server to go into passive mode. Returns the text that
           represents the port on which the server is listening, this text is
           in a suitable form to sent to another ftp server using the "port"
           method.

       The following methods can be used to transfer files between two remote
       servers, providing that these two servers can connect directly to each
       other.

       pasv_xfer ( SRC_FILE, DEST_SERVER [, DEST_FILE ] )
           This method will do a file transfer between two remote ftp servers.
           If "DEST_FILE" is omitted then the leaf name of "SRC_FILE" will be
           used.

       pasv_xfer_unique ( SRC_FILE, DEST_SERVER [, DEST_FILE ] )
           Like "pasv_xfer" but the file is stored on the remote server using
           the STOU command.

       pasv_wait ( NON_PASV_SERVER )
           This method can be used to wait for a transfer to complete between
           a passive server and a non-passive server. The method should be
           called on the passive server with the "Net::FTP" object for the
           non-passive server passed as an argument.

       abort ()
           Abort the current data transfer.

       quit ()
           Send the QUIT command to the remote FTP server and close the socket
           connection.

   MMeetthhooddss ffoorr tthhee aaddvveennttuurroouuss
       "Net::FTP" inherits from "Net::Cmd" so methods defined in "Net::Cmd"
       may be used to send commands to the remote FTP server.

       quot (CMD [,ARGS])
           Send a command, that Net::FTP does not directly support, to the
           remote server and wait for a response.

           Returns most significant digit of the response code.

           WWAARRNNIINNGG This call should only be used on commands that do not
           require data connections. Misuse of this method can hang the
           connection.

TTHHEE ddaattaaccoonnnn CCLLAASSSS
       Some of the methods defined in "Net::FTP" return an object which will
       be derived from this class.The dataconn class itself is derived from
       the "IO::Socket::INET" class, so any normal IO operations can be
       performed.  However the following methods are defined in the dataconn
       class and IO should be performed using these.

       read ( BUFFER, SIZE [, TIMEOUT ] )
           Read "SIZE" bytes of data from the server and place it into
           "BUFFER", also performing any <CRLF> translation necessary.
           "TIMEOUT" is optional, if not given, the timeout value from the
           command connection will be used.

           Returns the number of bytes read before any <CRLF> translation.

       write ( BUFFER, SIZE [, TIMEOUT ] )
           Write "SIZE" bytes of data from "BUFFER" to the server, also
           performing any <CRLF> translation necessary. "TIMEOUT" is optional,
           if not given, the timeout value from the command connection will be
           used.

           Returns the number of bytes written before any <CRLF> translation.

       bytes_read ()
           Returns the number of bytes read so far.

       abort ()
           Abort the current data transfer.

       close ()
           Close the data connection and get a response from the FTP server.
           Returns _t_r_u_e if the connection was closed successfully and the
           first digit of the response from the server was a '2'.

       almost every setup is different.

       A small script which yields the problem will probably be of help. It
       would also be useful if this script was run with the extra options
       "Debug =" 1> passed to the constructor, and the output sent with the
       bug report. If you cannot include a small script then please include a
       Debug trace from a run of your program which does yield the problem.
