Batch fetching is the ability to fetch the entire result set from an SQL query in one call, 
as opposed to iterating through the result set using row-oriented methods such as fetchrow_array( ), etc.

The DBI defines several methods for this purpose, including fetchall_arrayref( ) and
selectall_arrayref( ) , which basically retrieve the entire result set into a Perl data structure for
you to manipulate. They are invoked against a prepared and executed statement handle.

fetchall_arrayref( ) operates in three different modes depending on what arguments have been
passed to it. It can be called with no arguments, with a reference to an array slice as an argument, and
with a reference to a hash slice as an argument. We'll discuss these modes in the following sections.
